Hides the WordPress login password as it is typed on your iPad or other IOS device.

== Description ==

When you login to your WordPress site on your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch, each character of your password will be displayed as you enter it.

This is not ideal when you login to a WordPress site from your iPad as part of a presentation or screencast, or when you login in a public place and someone might be looking over your shoulder.

This plugin obscures the password as you type it on your iPad; It causes each character of the password to appear as a plain disc.

Note:
The iPad's soft keys highlight to indicate a keystroke. If you are presenting on an external screen or projector, in addition to masking the password with this plugin, it is recommended to use a bluetooth keyboard paired to your iPad so that the soft keyboard does not appear on the screen.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'iPad Rubberneck Disrupter' folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are the settings? =

We don't need any, so there aren't any.

= Why the daft name? =

Why not?

= This plugin contains a font. Is that licensed under the GPL? =

Of course! I created the font specifically for this GPL plugin. It's probably only of use for password masking, but you are welcome use the font in any GPL compatible project.

== Screenshots ==
1. The Login Screen no longer shows password characters as they are typed on an iPad
